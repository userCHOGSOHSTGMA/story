                        Looking at the news, the people became more hopeless: "A crater with a diameter of 2 kilometers has just impacted the Southern border of..."
                        Some families just kept hugging each other, others didn't care anymore and went on sleeping. 
                        The hole of the crater was more than 200 meters deep.
                        We've had a lot of impacts the last couple of years; the one in October 2097 was by far the worst. 
                        I remember being an 8-year-old boy when my family and I had to get all of our belongings and flee; 
                        I managed to grap my little guitar; the only thing out of ALL my stuff.
                        My family and I were well-off and were living on that beautiful hill.
                        We would play
