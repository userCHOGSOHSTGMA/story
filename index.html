                        <p>Looking at the news, the people became more hopeless: "A crater with a diameter of 2 kilometers has just impacted the Southern border of..." </p>
                        <p>Some families just kept hugging each other, others didn't care anymore and went on sleeping.</p>
                        <p>The hole of the crater was more than 185 meters deep.</p>
                        <p>We've had a lot of impacts the last couple of years; the one in October 2097 was by far the worst.</p>
                        <p>I remember being an 8-year-old boy when my family and I had to get all of our belongings and flee;
                        I managed to grap my little guitar; the only thing out of ALL my stuff.</p>
                        <p>My family was well-off and we were living on that beautiful hill.</p>
                        <p>We would play my favorite sport: baseball. I'd throw, my brother would catch. Those times were bliss.</p>
                        <p> I guess things have definitely changed. Still though, I trust the algorithms.</p> 
                        <p> All went well, everything was perfect until they screwed with it. </p>
                        <p> Why the need to modify it? The taskforce already approved the code and deemed it to have a 3.1% chance of failure.</p>
